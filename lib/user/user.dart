A hormone is released which signals one of the eggs in the ovary to grow into a sac-like follicle. Once the follicle has grown big enough, it signals to the uterus to start growing its lining again. After day 1 of the menstrual cycle, the follicular phase brings rise to the hormone levels again in anticipation for ovulation. Throughout this time, strength training has been shown to result in its greater increase in muscle strength. This makes it a great time of the month to be hitting the gym with some strength and high-intensity training sessions. Throughout this stage, there are also lower rates of tendon collagen synthesis which means the risk of musculoskeletal tissue injuries becomes higher. In fact, women have been found to be 3-6 times more likely than men to suffer musculoskeletal injuries when their oestrogen levels are elevated. The increasing levels of oestrogen also increase joint elasticity throughout this time and risks of ACL injuries have been noted as higher. With this in mind, longer warm-ups and less stretching may be favoured.''';

Around the time of ovulation, oestrogen levels are peaking which may favour the delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) meaning women recover quicker and can return to exercise with less muscle damage. At day 14, Oestrogen peaks and rise of a hormone called luteinizing hormone causes the release of the egg. At this time, energy levels are at the highest and itâ€™s a great time to push yourself to gain some additional endurance. This could make for a great time to shoot for some personal records. Additionally, as levels of the progesterone hormone are low your pain tolerance may come up a level.''';

The Luteal phase goes from day 15-18 to day 28-35 by which time the lining will shed again. In the final weeks of the menstrual cycle as progesterone levels increase the core body temperature will also rise. This can make working out in the heat feel slightly harder and a reduction in the sweat response is often observed. Throughout the luteal phase you may find it harder to reach goals you were hitting earlier in the month, for some there is an increase in breathing rate and depth as well as heart rates. Some individuals may also find their weight increases slightly as the body holds onto water and energy is stored. That run around the block might just end up feeling a whole lot harder than it normally would.''';
